# AmosKittensTests
Tests used in AmosKittens project to check if AMOS kittens works correct.

Some of this .amos programs can be useful, if you are learning to code AMOS,
the testes/examples do not come with lots of explanation, and are not hugely commented.

To edit this files you need "AMOS Profersonal" installed on real hardware (Amiga500/Amiga1200/Amiga4000) or in emulator like UAE, most popular version of UAE is WINUAE (Windows), but there is PSPUAE, FSUAE (Linux), EUAE (AmigaOS4) and few others.

If you like run .amos files you have two options, from AmosPro or from Amos Kittens under AmigaOS4.x.

If you interested in "Amos Kittens" interpreter, you need AmigaOS4, if you do not have AmigaONE computer, or AmigaOS4.x compatible like SAM440/460, then you need to emulate a PowerPC Amiga computer.

I suggest buying flowerpot, its small package that helps you setup WinUAE,

Next you need a ROM, the latest ROM you get from Hyperion entertainment, 
Kickstart 3.1.4 that is part of AmigaOS 3.1.4
(if you already have ROM like 3.1 or 3.0 then you skips this part.)

You need the Classic version of AmigaOS4.1

Once you own "AmigaOS 3.1.4" you can register it and get 3.1.4.1 that is bug fixed version as download option from Hyperion.

Next you need BlizzardPPC or CyberstomPPC rom, I suggest google it. the roms are bundled with Amiga Forever package, but as far as I know Cloanto never payed for lenience to use the ROMS in there emulation package, (BizzardPPC / CyberstormPPC roms was made by Phase5 that laster become bPlain i belive) so as far as I know the roms are abandonware. (The Companie that have right are not selling the rom, and Clonato who is selling it are not doing so legally as far as I know.)

Another option is to buy AmigaOS4.1 for 440/460, and use QEMU, it harder to setup and it work best on Linux, as far as I know AmigaOS4.1 version for 440/460 is only available from ACube-Systems webshop, this where find roms you need as well.

# AmosKittensTests
Tests used in AmosKittens project to check if AMOS kittens works correct.

Some of this .amos programs can be useful, if you are learning to code AMOS,
the testes/examples do not come with lots of explanation, and are not hugely commented.

To edit this files you need "AMOS Profersonal" installed on real hardware (Amiga500/Amiga1200/Amiga4000) or in emulator like UAE, most popular version of UAE is WINUAE (Windows), but there is PSPUAE, FSUAE (Linux), EUAE (AmigaOS4) and few others.

If you like run .amos files you have two options, from AmosPro or from Amos Kittens under AmigaOS4.x.

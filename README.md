# AmosKittensTests
Tests used in AmosKittens project to check if AMOS kittens works correct.

Some of this .amos programs can be also useful, if you are learning to code AMOS,
the testes/examples do not come with lots of explanation, and are not hugely commented.

What you need to edit this if is AMOSPRO installed on real hardware or in emulator like UAE, most popular version of UAE is WINUAE, but there is PSPUAE, FSUAE, EUAE and few others.

If you like run .amos files you have two options, from Amos pro or from Amos Kittens under AmigaOS4.x.
